Additionally, we have established the \"Forearm Loss Public Welfare Project\" in partnership with hospitals. As of 2022, this project has successfully launched at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, enabling nationwide coverage for eligible forearm loss applicants and providing them with BrainCo intelligent bionic hands with free installation. In 2023, the Zhejiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission, in collaboration with the Zhejiang Provincial Disabled Persons' Federation, initiated a public welfare project to assist people with limb disabilities through technology. This pioneering project in China provides free intelligent prosthetics to people with limb disabilities, helping them regain their ability to walk and improve their quality of life. The project is expected to provide 1,000 people with limb loss in Zhejiang Province with free BrainCo intelligent bionic legs."
