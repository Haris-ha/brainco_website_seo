We also actively participate in the \"Impoverished Disabled Children Relief Project\" by the Life Foundation, providing assistance to impoverished disabled children in need. Additionally, we have established the \"Forearm Loss Public Welfare Project\" in partnership with hospitals. As of 2022, this project has successfully launched at Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, enabling nationwide coverage for eligible forearm loss applicants and providing them with BrainCo intelligent bionic hands with free installation. In 2023, the Zhejiang Provincial Development and Reform Commission, in collaboration with the Zhejiang Provincial Disabled Persons' Federation, initiated a public welfare project to assist people with limb disabilities through technology. This pioneering project in China provides free intelligent prosthetics to people with limb disabilities, helping them regain their ability to walk and improve their quality of life. The project is expected to provide 1,000 people with limb loss in Zhejiang Province with free BrainCo intelligent bionic legs."

Through the Lightweight App and other methods, users can easily adjust and manage the prosthesis.",
    "m3_desc": "Lightweight M3 further enhances the excellent functions of Lightweight M2. While maintaining natural and beautiful gait, the motion modes have increased from 2 to 5. Users can easily perform alternating stair climbing, bent-leg downhill walking, and other movements close to able-bodied people. Whether crossing the street or catching a bus, users can freely adjust their pace like able-bodied people, easily switching from slow walk to light jog. The algorithm intelligently detects abnormal situations and can actively emergency stop in sudden scenarios, providing safer and more stable support.
