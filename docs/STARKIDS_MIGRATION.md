### 7. Technical Implementation

#### Animations (Framer Motion)
- `initial`, `animate` for page load animations
- `whileInView` for scroll-triggered animations
- `viewport={{ once: true }}` to prevent re-animation
- Staggered delays for sequential effects
- Scale, fade, and slide animations
- Custom transition durations

#### Fluid Typography
All text uses fluid responsive classes:
- `text-fluid-8xl` - Not used (too large)
- `text-fluid-7xl` - Statistics numbers (~72px)
- `text-fluid-6xl` - Not used
- `text-fluid-5xl` - Main section titles (~48px)
- `text-fluid-4xl` - Subtitles, features (~36px)
- `text-fluid-3xl` - Medium text (~30px)
- `text-fluid-2xl` - Body text, descriptions (~24px)
- `text-fluid-lg` - Smaller body text (~18px)
- `text-fluid-base` - Mobile text (~16px)

#### Responsive Width Strategy
- Container widths: `w-[90vw]`, `w-[85.2vw]`, `w-[79.7vw]`
- Max widths: `max-w-[1600px]`, `max-w-[1500px]`
- Element widths using vw: `w-[33.5vw]`, `w-[26.8vw]`, etc.
- Spacing with vw: `mt-[4.5vw]`, `gap-[2vw]`, `px-[5vw]`
- Prevents overflow on small screens

#### Cursor Interactions
- `cursor-pointer` on all clickable elements
- Video controls with cursor indication
- Hover effects would work with `cursor-pointer`

#### Image Optimization
- Next.js `<Image>` component throughout
- Proper `width` and `height` attributes
- Descriptive `alt` text from translations
- CDN URLs from Aliyun OSS

## Known Considerations

1. **Video Formats**: Using .mp4 and .mov formats - ensure browser compatibility
2. **Image CDN**: All images from Aliyun OSS - verify CDN performance
3. **Animation Performance**: Multiple scroll animations - test on lower-end devices
4. **Font Loading**: PingFang SC for mobile - ensure fallback fonts work
5. **Breakpoint**: Desktop/mobile split at `sm` (640px) - may need adjustment

1. ✅ Complete implementation
2. ⏳ Test all breakpoints and devices
3. ⏳ Verify i18n switching
4. ⏳ Check animation performance
5. ⏳ Validate accessibility
6. ⏳ Fix any overflow issues
